This is a game where you play as Plato inside his own allegory of the Cave.
You make choices, some that he might make, others not so much.
There are many choices that end up leading to absurd results, but this is supposed to be all in good fun.
Make sure you have your sound up enough to hear, there are some little tunes that play every now and then.

For grading purposes, I recommend using the flowchart attached as a .PNG to look at all of the paths.
+This contains most of the text, but lacks some more subtle changes as well as any ascii art or sound.
However, I recommend playing through it a bit first, if you have the time, so you don't ruin anything.

First off: this game will only run on Windows (sorry)
Before you can run it, you may have to run the included file called VBCRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe
This file will install some C++ redistributables that may not exist on your computer to begin with.
You may get some errors that things are already installed, just click through these errors, as this executable attempts to install multiple packages (all safe, I swear).
If you run across an error where you have the option to ‘ignore’, choose that option.
+This will prevent it from overwriting files that you already have.

Once you have completed this minor obstacle, you should be able to run the game by double clicking PlatoAndTheCave.exe.
Your computer may say this file is untrusted, but I trust it (I programmed all of it).
